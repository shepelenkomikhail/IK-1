I declare that this solution is my own work. I did not copy or use it from a third party solutions from third parties. I did not forward my solution to my fellow students, nor did I publish it. Eötvös Loránd University Student Requirements System (Organizational and Operational Regulations of ELTE, Volume II, § 74/C) states that as long as, as long as a student has been working on the work - or at least a significant part of it - of another student of another student's work as his or her own, it is a disciplinary offence. The most serious consequence of a disciplinary offence is dismissal from the university.",
